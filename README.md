# python-linked-list-library

To do:
Create a search function that returns true if a given book is in the library.
Add a "checked out" attribute to book objects and allow the user to "check out" books. Checked out books cannot be checked out again.
Create a "patron" object that allows users to create a user id (library card #?) and check out books.
Users should be able to print a list of their currently checked out books, as well as a list of all books in library.
